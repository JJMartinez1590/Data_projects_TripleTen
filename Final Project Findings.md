### 1. **Top Revenue-Generating Restaurants**

-   Domino’s Pizza leads all restaurants with the highest total sales, generating over ₹5 million in revenue.
    
-   Other high performers include Kouzina Kafe, Sweet Truth, and Pizza Hut. 
    
-   These brands benefit from high brand recognition, scalability, and the ability to have consistent service across locations.
    

### 2. **Customer Ratings vs. Sales**

-   There is not always a direct correlation between high ratings and high sales.
    
    -   Domino’s Pizza has a moderate rating of 4.2 but dominates in sales.
        
    -   While other restaurants like Grand Hotel(4.1) and Shah Ghouse Cafe(4.0) have the highest average ratings with 10k plus reviews, but don’t appear in the top sales list. 
    - Then you have McCafé by McDonalds which has a average rating of 4.6 but only has 1.5 million in sales.
        
-   Things like brand strength, marketing, and convenience may drive revenue more than ratings alone.
    

### 3. **Popular Cuisines**

-   Indian Chinese and North Indian cuisines top the sales charts.
    
-   Some popular cuisines like Pizza and Bakery items generate less revenue, indicating possible lower order volume or smaller average ticket size.
    

### 4. **Geographic Trends**

-   Cities like Bikaner, Noida, and Bangalore have the highest number of reviews, pointing to large user engagement, but do not appear the top 10 cities when ranked by AVG Rating.
    
-   Hyderabad neighborhoods dominate the highest-rated locations, this could suggest a regional trend of higher satisfaction or service quality in that area compared to others.
    

### 5. **Time-Based Insights**

-   Average Order Value(AOV) remained relatively steady over time.
    
-   Number of reviews has steadily declined since 2018, which could indicate either reduced customer feedback,  a drop in overall engagement, or change in customer preferences and using different services. 
    
-   Average ratings remained steady, even as sales declined slightly in 2020, possibly due to external events.
    

### 6. **Business Implications**

-   High revenue doesn’t necessarily mean high customer satisfaction, this could lead to drop in brand loyalties.
    
-   Restaurants with high ratings and lower sales represent growth opportunities with the right marketing and expansion strategies.
    
-   Regions with high review counts should be targeted for new product launches due to how active the customer engagement is. This could also lead to boost in sales as customers will always want to try the next new thing.
